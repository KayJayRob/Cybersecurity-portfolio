**Career Plans:**
After completing my cybersecurity course, I aim to apply my technical support background to security operations, risk management, and incident response. My goal is to strengthen my expertise in threat detection, vulnerability management, and security best practices to support organizations in safeguarding their digital assets. I aspire to grow into roles such as Security Analyst, SOC Analyst, or IT Security Administrator, where I can proactively mitigate risks and enhance cybersecurity frameworks.<br/><br/>
**Proud Project/Task:**
During my college internship, I created a webpage in order to track my progress and document my work, ensuring I met all the requirements for completing the non paid internship. The webpage served as a digital portfolio, detailing the projects I worked on, technical skills I applied, and challenges I overcame, if any. I designed it with the intent of incorporating sections for weekly updates, task summaries, and reflections on my learning experiences. This project not only helped me stay organized but also showcased my ability to apply web development and IT documentation skills in a real-world setting. It was a valuable experience that reinforced the importance of structured progress tracking and effective communication in IT.<br/><br/>
